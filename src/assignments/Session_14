Session_14:
===========

1. Write a program for the following scenario using LinkedList.
i. add one string object at first position.
ii. add one string object at last position.
iii. add one string object at 3rd position.
iv. delete one object from the LinkedList.
v. print the object at 5th position.
vi. update the object at 4th index.

2. Write a program to copy one collection objects into LinkedList.

3. Write a program to add few string objects in Vector and print all the objects on the console using all possible ways. 
(Hint: Use for loop, for each loop, Enumeration, Iterator, ListIterator)

4. Write a program to copy one collection objects into Vector.

==============
5. Write a program to add 8 string objects into HashSet and print all the objects on the console using all possible ways.

6. Write a program to copy one collection objects into HashSet.

7. Write a program to add 8 string objects into LinkedHashSet and print all the objects on the console using all possible ways.

8. Write a program to print duplicate numbers from integer array.
eg: int[] intArr= {4,3,2,5,4,3,5,4,10,11,2,1,13};
output: Duplicate numbers: [4, 3, 2, 5]

9. Write a program to print non-repetitive numbers from integer array.
eg: int[] intArr= {4,3,2,5,4,3,5,4,10,11,2,1,13};
output: Single Numbers=[10,11,1,13]
