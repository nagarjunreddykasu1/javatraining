ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector:
------------------------------

1. Write a program to retrieve the string objects from the ArrayList using all possible ways. (Hint: use for, for each, Iterator, ListIterator)

2. Write a program to store few string objects in ArrayList and perform following actions using ListIterator.
i. add one string object.
ii. update one string object.
iii. remove one string object.
iv. print all the objects of ArrayList using for loop and Iterator.

3. Write a program to sort the string objects in ascending and descending order and print them on the console.

4. Write a program to convert string to ArrayList and print all the objects on the console using Iterator.
String currencies="INR, USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, BDT, SGD, OMR, CNY";

5. Write a program to convert string array to ArrayList.

6. Write a program to define a method to compare two ArrayLists which contain string objects and return the unmatched objects from that method. (Note: Use Iterator)

7. Write a program for the following scenario.
i. add 5 sting objects into LinkedList
ii. remove any one object using name or index
iii. update any object.

8. Write a program to add string objects into LinkedList and print all the objects on the console using all possible ways (for, for each, Iterator, ListIterator).
