==========
Inheritance:
-------------

1. Write a program for the following scenario.
 i. Define a parent class with two instance variables and two instance methods.
 ii. Define a child class with two instance variables and two instance methods.
 iii. Call all the parent and child class members in main method of child class.
 
2. Write a program for the following scenario.
 i. Define a parent class with two instance variables and two instance methods.
 ii. Define a child class with two instance variables and two instance methods.
 iii. Call all the parent class members by creating object for parent class in main method of child class.
 
3. Write a program for the following scenario.
 i. Define a parent class with two instance variables and two instance methods.
 ii. Define a child class with two instance variables and two instance methods.
 iii. Call all the parent class members by creating object for child class in main method of child class.
 
4. Write a program for the following scenario. (multilevel inheritance)
i. Define a parent class with two instance variables and two instance methods.
ii. Define a child class with few instance members by inheriting the properties of above parent class.
iii. Define another class with few instance members by inheriting the properties of above child class and call all the instance members of all classes in main method.

5. Write a program for the following scenario. (Hierarchical inheritance)
i. Define a parent class with two instance variables and two instance methods.
ii. Define two classes with few instance members by inheriting the properties of above parent class and call all the instance members in main method of these two derived classes.

6.Write a program for the following scenario.
i. Define a parent class with two instance variables.
ii. Define a child class with two instance variables with same name as parent class and print the values of all variables.
