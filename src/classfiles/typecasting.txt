--------------
Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another data type.

1. Widening or implicit type casting:
The process of convering lower data type into higher data type is called widening type casting.

byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double

		char

2. Narrowing or explicit type casting

The process of converting higher data type to lower data type is called narrowing type casting.

double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

Variables:
==============
syntax:
[access_modifier] [static] datatype reference_variabe=value;

ex: int a=10;

1. Local Variables
