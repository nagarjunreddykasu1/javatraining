/*
Collection Framework:
=======================

The main objective of collection framework is to represent group of objects as single entity.

Collections are growable in nature. i.e., we can increase or decrease the size based on the requirement.

Collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous objects.

Every collection class is implemented based data structures. so predefined method support is available to manipulate the data.

Collections can hold only objects but not primitives.


						Collection (i)
						
List(i)																								Set(i)


ArrayList(c) CopyOnWriteArrayList(c) LinkedList)c)		Vector(c)							HashSet(c)	  				SortedSet(i)
																	
														Stack(c)							LinkedHashSet(c)			NavigableSet(i)
	
																														TreeSet(c)

ArrayList:
==========
 We can store both homogeneous and heterogeneous objects.
 Duplicate objects are allowed
 It is possible to insert NULL object.
 Insertion order is preserved. We can retrieve the objects in the same order which we inserted.
 data structure is growable array.
 We can retrieve the objects using for and for each and cursors (Iterator and ListIterator)
