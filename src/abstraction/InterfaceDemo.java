/*
Interface:
interface is same as class. but it contains both abstract an non-abstract methods like default method, static method, private method.

It is used to achieve multiple inheritance.

All the methods in interface are public and abstract by default.

All the variables in interface are public static final.

It is not possible to create object for interface. But we can make reference of it.

It is not possible to declare the constructor inside the interface.



syntax:
public interface <interfacename>{


}
